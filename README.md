# How to Use:
1. Use [Shizmob's rpatool](https://github.com/Shizmob/rpatool) to extract Camp Buddy assets to a folder. *<sub>you should end up with a folder full of .rpy files, the script is going to be extracting the character lines from those files.</sub>*
2. Download and then copy the `app.py` from this repo to inside of that folder.
3. Run it: `python3 app.py`

The script would print in the console every line that it finds. After it's finished, you should end up with two files: 
- camp-buddy.csv
- camp-buddy_semicolon-separated.csv
